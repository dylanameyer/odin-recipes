Recipes!
This is my first project on the Odin Project 
It will be a basic recipe website showcasing my very basic HTML skills. I have developed and designed websites in the past - including mine - but I am out of touch and starting back from scratch to further my career development and hone my skills.
It's always good to go back to your roots and relearn things. I have done it with weightlifting as well and now I am a powerlifter looking to compete.

Back to basics! :)
